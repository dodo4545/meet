Subject: Exercise 3.8 Submission - Redux State Management

Dear Instructor,

I have completed Exercise 3.8 on Redux state management. Please find my submissions below:

PART 1: ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM FOR myFlix APP

I have created a comprehensive architectural diagram documenting my Redux implementation for the myFlix application.

File attached: REDUX_ARCHITECTURAL_DIAGRAM.md

The diagram includes:
- Redux store structure with 4 state slices (movies, user, favorites, ui)
- 9 action types and action creators
- 4 domain reducers (movies, user, favorites, ui) combined with combineReducers()
- Complete data flow diagrams showing how actions move through the system
- State tree visualization
- Component integration patterns using useSelector and useDispatch
- Justification for why Redux was chosen over plain React state

PART 2: TO-DO LIST APP - DELETE FUNCTIONALITY

I have implemented the delete functionality for the To-Do app as requested.

CodeSandbox Link: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/tsm3xg

Implementation includes:
- DELETE_TODO action type
- deleteTodo(id) action creator
- Modified reducer to handle deletion using filter()
- Store testing with console.log() showing successful deletion
- Full console output demonstrating the delete functionality working correctly

BONUS EXERCISE: REDUX IMPLEMENTATION IN myFlix (COMPLETED!)

I have fully implemented Redux state management in my myFlix application, going beyond the requirements of this exercise.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/dodo4545/myFlix-client
Branch: bootstrap-styling-integration
Commit: ad41d52

Complete implementation includes:
- 9 action types defined in actionTypes.js
- 9 action creators in actions.js
- 4 domain reducers (movies.js, user.js, favorites.js, ui.js)
- Root reducer using combineReducers()
- Redux store with Redux DevTools support
- Provider wrapper in index.jsx
- MainView component fully converted from useState to useSelector/useDispatch
- All state management centralized in Redux store

The implementation has been tested and is working correctly. All code has been committed and pushed to GitHub.

Files changed: 12 files, 300+ insertions
Status: Production-ready and fully functional

SUMMARY

Part 1: Architectural diagram completed and attached
Part 2: To-Do delete functionality implemented in CodeSandbox
Bonus: Complete Redux implementation in myFlix app

All requirements have been met and the bonus exercise has been completed. The Redux implementation follows best practices with separated concerns, pure reducer functions, and proper integration with React components.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!

Best regards,
James J.
